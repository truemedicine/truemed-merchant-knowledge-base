### **\
Overview**

This widget educates customers about HSA/FSA eligibility, and indicates that they might qualify for HSA/FSA spending or reimbursement with their purchase.

It should be installed on your product pages, typically near the price or "Add to Cart" button:

*Your widget may look different - we are always working on improvements with the goal of increasing conversion.*

### **Installation**

1. Reach out to [merchants@truemed.com](mailto:merchants@truemed.com) if you do not know your Public Qualification ID

2. In Shopify, open the template where you’d like to add the widget. In the left-hand editor, select the section where you want the widget to appear, then click “Add block” to insert it.

3. Click **“Add block”**, then insert these 2 lines of HTML on your site, typically near the "Buy" or "Add to Cart" buttons (make sure to replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_QUALIFICATION_ID` with the ID found in Step 1):

   ```

<script src="https://static.truemed.com/widgets/product-page-widget.min.js" defer></script>
```

4. Adjust styles on the div to fit your page! For instance, on the Komuso site pictured above, they used the following to the `style` property on the div from line 1 above:

   ```
style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif;"
```

### **For Dark Backgrounds**

For pages with black or dark backgrounds, add the attribute `dark-mode` to enable a white Truemed logo. Update the text color within the `style` property:

```

<script src="https://static.truemed.com/widgets/product-page-widget.min.js" defer></script>
```

### **For Shopify Stores: Only Display on Certain Products**

> 💡To enable this feature, start by tagging your products in your Shopify dashboard. Shopify Tag Docs
>
> Choose `truemed-eligible` if your store sells fewer *eligible* products than *ineligible*.
>
> Otherwise choose `truemed-ineligible`. This is a great option if you have many *eligible* products but also sell gift cards or branded merch.

To only display the widget for products *with* the tag `'truemed-eligible'`:

```

<script src="https://static.truemed.com/widgets/product-page-widget.min.js" defer></script>
```

To only display the widget for products *without* the tag `'truemed-ineligible'`:

```

<script src="https://static.truemed.com/widgets/product-page-widget.min.js" defer></script>
```

That's it! Reach out with any technical questions to [merchants@truemed.com](mailto:merchants@truemed.com).

2. Keep the Truemed logo from oversizing:

  }}
</style>
```

```
